## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

It was the most complete project! At first, this allowed us to better understand and identify the difference between front-end and back-end. But, in the end, the most important is the way you communicate with others.

I realized how many essential it is to have a constant dialogue with the other team in order to know which is prioritary! 

In the end, it was really interesting to see the 
primordiality of clean code and understandable code, but also to know how to transmit the logic and files.
